Hello!
Welcome again to our sleep study!  Hopefully you’ve downloaded the app by now and have used it at least once.  What we’d like you to do in the next week is to use the app every single night to track your sleep quality.  Please go to sleep and wake up at your normal bedtime and wake-up time.  
The only caveat is that we would like you to refrain from using any devices with backlit screens 30 minutes prior to sleep.  For some of you, we know this could be very difficult, but please try your best to comply with these instructions.  We understand that we’re all human and impulse control is tough at times.  If you do end up watching shows / using your phone within 30 minutes of going to bed, we’d like you to make a note of that date and let us know.  We promise we won’t get mad at you for not listening, but it’s super helpful that you’re honest and not just tell us what you think we’d like to hear.  This study won’t last forever and we really appreciate your time and effort!

Hello!
Welcome again to our sleep study!  Hopefully you’ve downloaded the app by now and have used it at least once.  What we’d like you to do in the next week is to use the app every single night to track your sleep quality.  Please go to sleep and wake up at your normal bedtime and wake-up time.  
The only caveat is that we would like you to use some electronics for the 30 minutes before going to sleep.  This could include anything from watching shows on your computer to checking social media on your phone to playing video games.  Really anything with a backlit screen.  For some of you with good sleep habits, this will be a departure from your normal ritual and we apologize.  But please try your best to comply with these instructions.  We understand that we’re all human and impulse control is tough at times.  If you don’t end up using any electronics 30 minutes of going to bed, we’d like you to make a note of that date and let us know.
