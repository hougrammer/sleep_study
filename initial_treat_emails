Mails sent on Mar 23 to control and treatment subjects (mentioned in mar23_29_responses_email_prep)

Subject: Experiment starts from today. Please follow the below instructions !!!

----------
CONTROL GROUP - NO SCREEN TIME

Hello!

Good evening.

Hopefully you have downloaded the app and have been using it for a while. Please email your baseline sleep data from Sleep cycle app -> Settings -> Advanced -> Database  -> Export Database to w241sleepstudy@gmail.com. This will send the ‘sleepdata.csv’ as an attachment using the mail client configured on your phone.

For this upcoming week - Mar 23 to Mar 29 (till next Friday), we would like you to continue using the app as usual (by setting the alarm and dismissing it in the morning) every single night to track the sleep quality.  You can go to bed and wake-up as per your normal routine. The only caveat is that we would like you to refrain from using any devices with backlit screens 30 minutes prior to sleep.

For some of you, we know this could be very difficult, but please try your best to comply with these instructions.  We understand that we are all human beings and impulse control is tough at times.  If you do end up using any electronic devices (however long they were) within 30 minutes of going to bed, please make a note of the date and let us know.  This study won’t last forever and we really appreciate your time and effort!

TREATMENT GROUP - SCREEN TIME

You can go to bed and wake-up as per your normal routine. The only caveat is that we would like you to use some electronic device for 30 minutes before going to bed. This could include anything from watching shows on your laptop/TV/tablet device, checking social media on your phone, playing video games etc. Really anything with a backlit screen ON.

For some of you with good sleeping habits, this would be a departure from your normal ritual and we apologize for the deviation. We know this could be very difficult, but please try your best to comply with these instructions. If you don’t end up using any electronics device 30 minutes before going to bed, we would like you to make a note of the date and let us know.  This study won’t last forever and we really appreciate your time and effort!
